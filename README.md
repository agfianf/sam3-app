## Why Choose AnnotateANU?

### ⚡ AI-Powered Precision
Don't waste hours clicking points. Our integration with SAM3 (Segment Anything Model 3) allows for automatic object detection via text prompts or simple bounding boxes. Get pixel-perfect masks in milliseconds.

### 🔒 Privacy by Design
We utilize IndexedDB for browser-based storage. Your dataset remains strictly local on your machine. We do not upload your images to any server, ensuring total data sovereignty and zero latency.

### 🛠️ Flexible & Export Ready
Whether you need Bounding Boxes or Polygon Segmentation, we support it. Export instantly to industry standards: COCO JSON, YOLO format, or ZIP archives with a single click.

## ✨ Features

### ⚡ Automated Segmentation
SAM3 inference runs locally or via optimized endpoints to auto-segment objects instantly. Use text prompts or bounding boxes to get pixel-perfect masks in milliseconds.

### 🎯 Manual Precision
Need to tweak the AI's work? Use our pixel-perfect pen, rectangle, and polygon tools for fine-tuning your annotations with complete control.

### 📦 Batch Workflow
Load hundreds of images at once. Our interface handles batch processing without browser lag, making large dataset annotation a breeze.

### ⌨️ Lightning Shortcuts
Designed for power users. Keep your hands on the keyboard and annotate without breaking flow with comprehensive keyboard shortcuts.

### 💾 Export Ready
Export to COCO JSON, YOLO format, or ZIP archives with one click. Industry-standard formats ready for your ML pipelines.

### 🔒 Local-First Storage
Your data stays local with IndexedDB - no server uploads, total privacy. All processing happens in your browser or on your local backend.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose** (recommended)
- **Python 3.12+** and **uv** (for local backend development)
- **Node.js 18+** and **npm** (for local frontend development)
- **HuggingFace Account & Token** (required for SAM3 model access)

### HuggingFace Setup (REQUIRED)

SAM3 is a gated model. You must:

1. Create account: https://huggingface.co/join
2. Request access: https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam3
3. Generate token: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
4. Add to backend/.env:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env and add:
HF_TOKEN=hf_your_token_here
```

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Setup environment
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env and add your HF_TOKEN

# 2. Start all services
make docker-up

# 3. Access the application
# Frontend: http://localhost:5173
# Backend API: http://localhost:8000
# API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## 🚀 Roadmap - Coming Soon

We are constantly evolving. Here's what's shipping next to AnnotateANU:

### 🔌 Bring Your Own Model (BYOM)
Connect your existing custom models via API. Pre-label your images using your own weights to bootstrap the annotation process even faster.

### ☁️ Enterprise Storage Integration
Move beyond browser storage. We're adding native integration for MinIO and S3-compatible object storage, allowing you to pull and sync datasets directly from your cloud buckets.
